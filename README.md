# DynamicResourceTrees
An addon for the minecraft mod DynamicTrees that allows to create custom dynamic trees of some type of resource.

This mod adds leaves blocks, log blocks, amber blocks, acorns (also work as seed) and resin for each resource type.
It also registers the dynamic trees and makes them drop resin and acorns.
